## Rules of the game

The game runs in rounds. Each player plays at the same time and the round ends after couple of seconds.
The player can build its new village, where new villager can be generated. A villager can move by one
cell on the map in each round and at the end of each round the villager can produce some resources 
according the type of the cell he is standing on. When he is standing on the village, he produces 
gold. 

The player with more gold wins. 

A player can build new village only if he has enough resurces and on the same cell where some of his 
villagers are standing. The villager is removed from the cell after that.

A player can create a soldier from a villager with enough resources. The soldier can move by one cell
as well, but he can attack to the other player's units.
